# codingbat-solutions-python
My solutions to the Python problems on codingbat.com. Each solution is organized under its respective section's .py file and is preceded by a comment with the directions from the site for that problem. All solutions were done with just a return statement as a challenge to myself, although it does sacrifice readability.
